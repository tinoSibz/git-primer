# Setting up Git

---

## Installing Git on your computer

- Git is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.
- Download the instructions are online: <https://git-scm.com/downloads>
- To check if Git is installed, open a terminal or command prompt and type:
```bash
git --version
``` 
- <span style="color: #BF616A;">**Note**</span>: This should display the version of Git you have installed. If you installed Git on Windows and didn't modify the `PATH` environment variable, use **Git Bash** for this.

## Creating a Github account

- Go to <https://github.com/> and sign up for a new account.
- Fill in the required information and select a plan.
- Verify your email address.

## Configuring your local Git installation

- We can setup the name and email address which will be used as the default for all your commits.
- In your terminal/command prompt, type: 
```bash 
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
```
To see the full configuration, run:
```bash
git config --list
```

## Tools to make your life easier

- There are various tools that make working with Git significantly simpler, these include standalone tools like [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). IDEs like VS Code come with built-in support for working with Git and can be enhanced further with extensions such as the [Git Graph Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mhutchie.git-graph).
